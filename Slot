	Purpose: The purpose of this program is to 
				serve as the main (driver) class
				of the Slot Machine program. The 
				program will contain the variables
				needed to operate the program.
				It will ask the user for an amount
				of money to be betted, run the operations,
				and reveal the "images" and winnings on 
				the screen.
